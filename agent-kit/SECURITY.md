# SECURITY.md

- Report vulnerabilities privately via GitHub Security Advisories
  ("Report a vulnerability" on the Security tab of
  `ThyFriendlyFox/jev-curate`). No email contact is published; the
  maintainer adds one here if they want one. **Never open a public issue
  for a vulnerability.**
- Acknowledgment within 72 hours; fix-or-plan within 14 days;
  coordinated disclosure after a fix ships.
- Supported: latest minor release, unless stated otherwise.
- Secrets never enter the repo — not code, config, fixtures, or history.
  CI uses Actions secrets (`TYPESAFE_API_KEY` for the live gate, when
  set); local dev uses an untracked `.env` or an exported variable.
- For the agent: security-shaped work overrides normal routing. A
  security fix may ship out-of-band as a patch release at any time,
  without waiting for the weekly cycle.
